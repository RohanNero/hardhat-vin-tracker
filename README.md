# Hardhat-vin-tracker

### The purpose of hardhat-vin-tracker is to allow any car owner to view their automobile's reported history from previous owners

To combat the pitfall of proving you actually own the vehicle I want to create an alternative contract that has owner/admins
For example If I sell the car I retain admin ability and the next person who buys it can submit info to the contract for the admin to
check themselves. If the person proves they have the car to the admin then they can get priveleges/ownership.

**Ideally you wouldn't have to do any of that and this would be the norm so that whenever people sold the car they would also transfer
their car's respective smart contract. Dealership would have a database of smart contracts they can update will repairs and autowork,
this would potentially help cars sell because it has details of the new parts and work done on it. People would prefer a car with a
detailed history over a complete mystery.**
